# CHAPTER 10: REPOSITORIES
**Repository** is not a **Data Access Object (DAO)**. **Repository** represents **collection**, and **DAO**s
are more focused on Database structure and are far more table-centric. Typically a DAO would contain CRUD methods
for particular domain object

#### Summarization and conclusion
 - **repository is** an implementation of a specific type of collection, called **Set**. **Set** is a data-structure
 with an invariant that **does not** contain **duplicate entries**
